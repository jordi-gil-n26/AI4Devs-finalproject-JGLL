-- V6__create_reviews.sql
-- Creates the Review table per data-model.md.
--
-- A Review is written by a Guest about a Property, tied to a single Booking.
-- Business rules:
--   - One review per booking (enforced by UNIQUE on booking_id).
--   - rating must be between 1 and 5 inclusive.
--   - Reviews are only created after a booking reaches "completed" status,
--     but that transition is enforced in the application layer, not here.
--
-- FK targets:
--   bookings(id)   from V5__create_bookings.sql
--   properties(id) from V3__create_properties.sql
--   guests(id)     from V2__create_users.sql
